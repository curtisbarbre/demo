this is demo file one

adding changes to it to push to remote

well that was a pain in the ass.
turns out I had to get my username credentials sorted.
ended up running:

git remote add origin https://{username}:{password}@github.com/{username}/project.git
|
git remote add demoRemote https://curtisbarbre:{password}@github.com/curtisbarbre/demo.git

to set up a new remote instead of just using the url. then :
git push demoRemote CAD-2nd-Draft

origin remote didn't have the password. possibly bc the repo was made on desktop.

ran

git config --global credential.helper wincred

supposedly saved my credentials.  we'll see.
I'm gonna modify a CAD part and push.

another change to push. lets see if credential.helper lets me push to origin, well that seems like it worked.

yes.  as expected i can push to origin now (without displaying my password).  when I commit the shell and desktop see it, online does not until i push to origin.

added aliases
$ git config --global alias.co checkout
$ git config --global alias.br branch
$ git config --global alias.ci commit
$ git config --global alias.st status
$ git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'
$ git config --global alias.visual '!gitk' 
the last one launches an external line of code using !
gives us gitk

git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
